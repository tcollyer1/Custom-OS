# Custom-OS
A custom, barebones 64-bit OS I'm learning to write from scratch using assembly and C++. So far it includes a simple bootloader and loads sectors from the disk into memory.

## Tools and Software
- Visual Studio 2019
- [Bochs](https://bochs.sourceforge.io) for emulating a PC and x86 CPU for the OS to run on
- [NASM](https://nasm.us) (Netwide Assembler)

## To Run
To run, ensure Bochs is installed and run `assemble.bat`, which will generate an `.flp` floppy image usable in Bochs. Further configuration will be added later.

## Features
As I learn more and the OS is fleshed out, I will list features here. Currently the OS has no interactivity yet other than viewing strings displayed to the screen.
